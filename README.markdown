# HELLO!

![Casey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdammers/suitcase/master/splash/splash3.jpg)

I'm Casey, the Sentient Suitcase.

You may know me from famous internet movies, like [this one](https://i.imgur.com/JvkRXqE.mp4).

Anyway, here I am for your enjoyment in FlightGear.

Controls:

- Rudder and elevator controls move my eyes. That's all they do.
- Throttle to channel determination into mental projection; this will move me
  forward, sometimes. But be careful, I might topple over.
- You can use differential braking to try and steer me. Careful with those
  brakes though, because I might topple over.
- I may run out of Sentience and/or Determination; when that happens, use the
  Fuel and Payload dialog to raise me to a higher plane of conscience again.
